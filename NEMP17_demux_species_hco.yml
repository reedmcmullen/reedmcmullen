##### REFERENCE DATA #####
#
# Path to the base file name of the unique k-mer files
#  (this is the -o argument to utils/get_unique_kmers)
kmers: "~/genomes/species_kmers/human_chimp_orangutan_k32"
# Path to cell barcode whitelist (i.e. from CellRanger)
#   (can be gzipped)
whitelist: "~/libraries/3M-february-2018.txt.gz"
# If demultiplexing ATAC-seq, path to ATAC-seq barcode
#   whitelist (i.e. from CellRanger). If not, omit
# whitelist_atac: "/path/to/atac_barcodes.txt.gz"

##### INPUT DATA #####

# File listing library names, 1 per line
libs: "~/libraries/NEMP17_libs.txt"
# Path to directory containing RNA-seq data
rna_dir: "/path/to/RNAseq"
# Path to directory containing ATAC-seq data (or omit)
#atac_dir: "/path/to/ATACseq"
# If ATAC lib names are different from RNA-seq lib names,
#   pass a file mapping ATAC seq library to RNA-seq library,
#   tab separated. If not, omit
#atac_map: "/path/to/ATACseq_to_RNAseq_library_names.txt"
# Path to directory containing custom type (i.e.
#    CRISPR guide capture, Antibody capture, etc.) reads
#custom_dir: "/path/to/custom_seq"
# Required if providing custom-type data: first two columns
#    map custom library name to data type (i.e. "CRISPR").
#    Third column, mapping custom library name to RNA-seq
#    library name, is required if names of libraries differ.
#custom_map: "/path/to/custom_to_RNAseq_library_names.txt"

##### SETTINGS #####

# Directory to write output data
output_directory: "/wynton/group/pollen/reedmcmullen/run_cellbouncer/run_demux_species/NEMP17"
# Should cell barcodes have library names appended to them in
#    the output species assignment files?
append_libname: false
# Should lib names be appended in CellRanger format (numeric index?)
cellranger: true
# Should lib names be prepended to barcodes in Seurat format?
seurat: false
# How many pieces should input data be broken up into and processed
#    in parallel? default = 100
num_chunks: 100
# Should reads also be separated into individual files per species?
#    Alternative: write out species assignments but do not split up
#    FASTQ files. Default = true
demux_reads: true
# Should reads being demultiplexed (if demux_reads: true) be split
#    into pieces, demultiplexed, and then joined back together? 
#    Default = true
demux_pieces: true
# How many parallel threads should each job be given? 
threads: 1
# What is the maximum expected memory consumption per job in the 
#    k-mer counting step, in GB?
